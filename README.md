# Disko _<img src="./assets/icon.png" width="40" align="right"/>_

Disko is a minimalist **MacOS** application that allows you to see how much disk space individual folders and files are taking up. It is broadly inspired by the _Disk Usage Analyzer_ application on GNU/Linux.

You can learn more about it on my personal website [here](https://apps.robbb.in/disko).
